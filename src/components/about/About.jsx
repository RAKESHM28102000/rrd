    <div className='about-p'><p>Virtual desktops and apps can help boost employee experience across devices and apps, wherever employees are working. But traditional on-premises VDI solutions pre-date the widespread use of cloud, and IT teams are struggling to provide distributed workforces with the fast, reliable access to both legacy and modern apps they need to stay productive. On-premises deployments and management alone can stifle capacity and the ability to deliver resources to the people who need them, when they need them.</p></div>

<p>
The ability to deploy and manage VDI desktops and apps in the hybrid cloud eases the pressure on existing 
IT infrastructure, eliminates distress, and positions you for success. Now is the time to go beyond traditional 
on-premises VDI solutions to modern, cloud-hosted or hybrid-managed approaches.
